# Bachelors-EEG-project
	The project entails analyzing an EEG dataset from a social cognition study in which participants did a finger-tapping task with a virtual partner (VP), which was a computer program that adapted to the human participants to different degrees. The aim is to analyse whether sensorimotor rhythms (mu - 10 Hz and 20 Hz oscillations) are modulated by the adaptation of the VP. Learning objectives: - literature review of mu and beta-desynchronisation, in relation to social cognition and interaction - preprocessing of EEG data from a social interaction study - analysis of ICA components, wavelets, and event-related mu-desynchronization (mu ERD) - statistical comparison of mu ERD across interactive conditions (different degrees of VP adaptation, and self condition), e.g., with cluster permutation tests
